        <p>Year of Study: 2nd</p>
        <p>Award: BSc Computer Science</p>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Sayoojya Santhosh, a second-year BSc Computer Science student who specializes in AI. My adventure through the Technosphere started with an awe over how tech influences our lives. This curiosity, I felt, grew into a passion over time and eventually became my love for web development and AI technologies while I offer solutions that are innovative and impactful. I have always had a passion for blending creativity with technical skills. This is also evident in my focus on creating well-designed and functional websites with other possibilities for customization and use with CSS or JS. I have also been privileged to have learned new technologies, followed the latest trends, and adapted those trends into my projects. My ultimate career goal is to excel as a front-end developer and grow into a versatile software developer. What drives me is the idea of creating applications that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust. I am particularly motivated by the challenge of solving problems that have real-world significance and seeing the positive impact of my work.</p>
